Ametek has been my main client while working with BeAPartOf and it is also the biggest client the company has ever had.
We worked together to create a theme that could fit all the differnt needs of Ametek in more than 50 differnt sites.

The customizations are both aesthetic and functional.
The core of the customizations had to do with the fact that ametek has 3 types of stores:
- Country stores that need to handle different stores and their branding, with the main issue being that customers not always can access to all stores of a country. This required a header with the possibility to switch between stores when not logged in and filtered header for only approved customer stores when the customer has logged in.
- Single store, which was much more simple and straigh forward, customers can access to all products once registered and approved.
- Mix between the 2 types, where there is a store with multiple substores that have their own landing page and branding but customers can access to all products.
