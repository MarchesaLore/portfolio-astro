The course was structured in a 4 weeks course.
The first week was to learn the importance of the 'graphic idea' and apply this learning to making images using graphic design methods of:
<ul>
<li>appropriation and recontextualisation</li>
<li>crop</li>
<li>contrast</li>
<li>gestalt</li>
<li>juxtaposition</li>
</ul>
<p>
The first assignment was to create 3 illustrations using some free material online that will represent 3 feelings randomly picked.
