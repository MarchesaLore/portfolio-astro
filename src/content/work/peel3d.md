While working for BeAPartof in Toronto, I built the website for the company Peel 3d, an amazing company based in Montreal that sells 3d scanners. 

The website is using BigCommerce and the theme is built using stencil, the main goal for thi site is ot have a modern looking site that offers great user experience.

The most important page is the product page peel 3d and peel 3d.CAD (similar scanner different softwares) the idea is to have in one page the possibility to customize the purchase of the scanner selecting the licence, service plan, and adding as many accessories as the customer wish.

I have used GraphQL to get the infomation in this page and there are many details that I am proud of like the calculation of the total while adding and removing the customizations while keeping the cost separate for subscriptions and single purchase cost, the css changes and the smooth transictions in different areas of the page.
