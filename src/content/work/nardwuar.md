This dynamic web application pays homage to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nardwuar" target="_blank">Nardwuar</a>, a renowned Canadian journalist celebrated for his entertaining and insightful interviews with various musicians.


*Project Overview*

Angular Expertise: Demonstrates proficiency in Angular, a powerful front-end framework, to create a seamless and responsive user interface.

Multi-Page Structure: Utilizes Angular's routing capabilities to implement a multi-page architecture. Currently featuring the Welcome and Timeline pages for a rich and interactive user experience.


*Timeline Feature Highlights*

Data Handling: Implements a sophisticated timeline feature by loading interview data from a JSON file. Interviews are intelligently sorted by date, creating a chronological display for an engaging user experience.

Position Calculation: Leverages a meticulous method, calculatePosition, to dynamically assign positions to interviews on the timeline based on the date, ensuring a visually intuitive representation.


*YouTube Video Integration*

Secure Video Loading: Addresses security concerns related to loading YouTube videos by incorporating Angular's DomSanitizer to dynamically generate SafeResourceUrl. This ensures a secure and seamless integration of YouTube videos within the application.

Communication Between Components: Demonstrates effective communication between components with the use of @Output() and EventEmitter. Clicking on an interview triggers the loading of the corresponding video in the main section, showcasing an elegant interaction between elements.


*Noteworthy Mention*
